# My Personal Blog [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/bdbb0d4a-06fe-4acd-8117-18e4957cc978/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/doganozturk/deploys)

This is my personal blog which I built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and a host of other small web technologies. The project has very simple setup, I especially like the idea of small CSS & JS footprint, inlining these resources for high [pagespeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https://doganozturk.dev) performance.

I'm open to suggestions, especially on the page performance side of things ðŸŽ‰

## Local Development

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

If you want to set up a development environment for the project , you need these:

```
brew install node@12.13.2 (or higher)
```
*Note: Especially for Node, I strongly recommend usage of a Node version management tool such as [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)* or [n](https://github.com/tj/n).

### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/doganozturk/blog.git

cd blog

# Install project dependencies
npm install

# Start local dev environment
npm start
```
